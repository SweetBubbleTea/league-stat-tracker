A web application that is designed to provide statistical data for several Riot Games titles, including League of Legends and Valorant. 
For League, it provides data on champion mastery, win rate, itemization, creep score, KDA, and many more. For Valorant, 
it supplies a leaderboard, esports query, skin query, and many more. 

## Disclaimers

Riot Tea is a personal project that is not associated with any Riot Games titles in any shape or form.

Riot Tea is functional without having to obtain your own personal API key from Riot Games; however,
Development API keys from Riot Games has a shelf life of 24 hours. This would mean that the in order to use the web application, 
a personal API key from Riot Games MAY be needed. 

Currently still in devleopment. Use at your own discretion.
